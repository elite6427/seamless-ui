## General convention to follow :

### **Border-radius** : Border radius of each card is `rounded-2xl`

### **Border :**

- border thickness : `border-2`
- border color : `border-gray-200`

### **Paddings :**

The padding could be variable depending on the card sizes and UI requirements but normally it is `p-6`

### Font :

|  | heading | Normal text | sub text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| size | text-2xl | text-lg | text-sm |
| color | text-gray-800 | text-gray-800 / text-gray-600 ( according to the design) | text-gray-600 |
| font | semi-bold | semibold / normal | normal |

### Width & heights :

The width of the component totally depends on the design.

But we usually use these 3 widths 🔽

- `w-48` → for small components
- `w-72` → for medium components
- `w-96` → for big components

The height of the components depends on the amount of content on it. We need to make it fluid. **Giving a fixed height is not recommended at all.** 

## Buttons :

We need to use the already built buttons for this. **[Buttons](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/seamless-ui/tree/main/Buttons)** 🔗 . Don’t use any buttons outside this.

## Icons :

Icons must be used from **[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)** 🖇️

**Note :** You need to use a solid 24X24 SVG form heroicons.
