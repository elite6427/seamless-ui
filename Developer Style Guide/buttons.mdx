### Font

For all buttons font is : **`font-medium`**

### Hover Color

For all primary and secondary button the hover color is **`hover:bg-blue-700`**.

### Transition ( `transition-all` )

whenever there is a hover effect, one must use `transition-all` class with it.

**Example** : For success the normal background color is `bg-green-500` so the hover effect of this will be `bg-green-600`

## Example of Primary Button file ðŸ‘‡

This is the way we have all the buttons. 

Like in the `Primary/button.html` file you can find all the buttons of different size like this which maintains the design system above and also have a disabled state.

## Icon guidelines:

Mostly all the icons are taken from â†’ [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/)

`Icon-text-gap` :  We follow a convention of equal margin between the text and the icon as padding in y  axis `px`. and always the margin is given from the side of icon.

|  | Width | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | w-4 & h-4 | Hero Icons mini |
| Medium | w-5 & h-5 | Hero Icons mini |
| Large | w-6 & h-6 | Hero Icons filled |
